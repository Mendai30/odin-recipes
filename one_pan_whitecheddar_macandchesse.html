    <p><b>This is a recipe for making great One Pan White Cheddar Mac and Chesse </b></p>
<h1>"Description"</h1>
    <p>Directions
Step1:
Combine macaroni, milk, water, garlic salt, and salt in a Dutch oven on a stovetop over medium-high heat. 
Bring to a boil, stirring occasionally. 
Reduce heat to a simmer and cook, stirring frequently so noodles don't stick to the pan, 
until noodles are soft and most of the liquid has been absorbed, 7 to 10 minutes.
Step2:
Remove pot from heat and stir in margarine and pepper until melted. 
Stir in Cheddar cheese and 1/4 cup of the Parmesan cheese until melted.
Step3:
Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.
Step5:
Top pasta with bread crumbs, remaining 1/4 cup of Parmesan cheese, and bacon bits.
Step6:
Place Dutch oven under the broiler until topping is lightly browned and crispy, 1 to 3 minutes. 
Top with chives and serve immediately.
